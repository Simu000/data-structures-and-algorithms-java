# Data Structures and Algorithms – Java

This repository contains my practice and learning journey for Data Structures and Algorithms using Java.

## Purpose
- Build strong problem-solving skills
- Prepare for technical interviews
- Maintain clean, well-explained solutions
- Track my learning consistently through GitHub commits

## How this repository is organized
Problems are grouped by topic (arrays, linked lists, recursion, trees, dp, etc.).

Each topic may contain:
- Java solution files
- A README explaining:
  - My approach
  - Intuition behind the solution
  - Edge cases
  - Challenges I faced
  - What I learned

## Problem Sources
- LeetCode
- Interview-style problems
- Custom practice problems

## Notes
This repository is meant for **learning and revision**, not just collecting solutions.
I focus on clarity, correctness, and understanding rather than shortcuts.

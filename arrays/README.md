# Arrays

This directory contains problems related to arrays, focusing on building strong fundamentals and recognizing common problem-solving patterns.

## Topics Covered
- Traversal and basic operations
- Prefix sums
- Sliding window technique
- Two-pointer approach
- Frequency counting
- Sorting-based problems

## Approach & Intuition
Most array problems rely on identifying patterns rather than brute force.
I focus on:
- Reducing time complexity
- Avoiding unnecessary extra space
- Writing clean and readable logic

## Common Challenges
- Off-by-one errors
- Incorrect loop boundaries
- Handling edge cases like empty arrays or single-element arrays

## What I Learned
- Simple optimizations can significantly reduce complexity
- Clear variable naming helps avoid logical mistakes
- Understanding constraints is crucial before choosing an approach

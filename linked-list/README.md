# Linked Lists

This directory contains problems based on singly and doubly linked lists, with an emphasis on pointer manipulation and edge case handling.

## Topics Covered
- Insertion and deletion operations
- Reversal of linked lists
- Fast and slow pointer technique
- Recursion with linked lists
- Handling head and tail edge cases

## Approach & Intuition
Linked list problems are less about values and more about **correct pointer movement**.
I focus on:
- Preserving node references
- Updating links in the correct order
- Handling null and single-node cases safely

## Common Challenges
- Losing the head reference
- Incorrect pointer reassignment
- Missing edge cases (first or last node)

## What I Learned
- Drawing the list helps visualize pointer changes
- Writing dry runs prevents logical bugs
- Clean pointer handling leads to simpler solutions
